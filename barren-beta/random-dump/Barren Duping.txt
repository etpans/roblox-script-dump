#1 Dupe:
The first dupe requires some skill but is less detected if only done one or two times (does not matter if sucessful or not).
 - You first must find or create an object which damages you. For example, a barricade or wall
 - Place a bedroll and be prepare to hit the object and drop the items you want
 - Then press play on Barren.
 - Once you see the new roblox application running on your taskbar you need to hit then drop your desired items you want to dupe
Note: You need to drop your items right as the other Roblox game loads. Once it loads you should be either exited or kicked 
out of the game. If your PC is to fast you may not be able to drop your items and dropping too many times may get you BANNED.
 - After getting kicked out of the game rejoin the SAME game to pick up your items
 - Rinse and repeat
#2 Dupe:
